# Wickra Benchmark — Go

---

**Part of the [Wickra ecosystem](https://github.com/wickra-lib) — for Go. `go get github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-benchmark-go` — over the C ABI via cgo, prebuilt library bundled in the module.**

Recompute a curated benchmark case or suite with the deterministic Wickra engine
and confirm its report and hash, from Go over the C ABI hub (cgo).

## Install

Use the published **`wickra-benchmark-go`** module, which bundles the prebuilt C ABI
library for every platform, so `go get` + `go build` works with no extra steps
(a C compiler is still required, as the binding uses cgo):

```bash
go get github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-benchmark-go
```

`wickra-benchmark-go` is generated from this directory by the release pipeline: it mirrors
the Go sources, the vendored C ABI header (`include/wickra_benchmark.h`) and the prebuilt
libraries under `lib/<goos>_<goarch>/`. On Linux/macOS the library path is baked
in via rpath; on Windows the DLL must be discoverable at run time (next to the
executable or on `PATH`).

The binding links the prebuilt C ABI library, staged per platform under
`lib/<goos>_<goarch>/`, with the header vendored under `include/`. Building from
source requires a C toolchain (cgo) and the staged native library.

### Building from this repository (contributors)

This `bindings/go` directory is the development source. To build it directly,
compile the C ABI and stage the library into the per-platform directory cgo
links against:

```bash
cargo build -p wickra-benchmark-c --release
mkdir -p bindings/go/lib/linux_amd64                 # match your GOOS_GOARCH
cp target/release/libwickra_benchmark.so bindings/go/lib/linux_amd64/
```

Then, with the library on the loader path, run `go test ./...` from this directory.

## Quick start

Everything goes through a `Benchmark` driven by JSON commands — the same command
protocol every Wickra binding shares.

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"

    wickra "github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-benchmark-go"
)

func main() {
    b := wickra.New()
    defer b.Close()

    runCase := map[string]any{
        "cmd": "run_case",
        "case": map[string]any{
            "id":            "sma-crossover-01",
            "strategy":      strategySpec, // a wickra-backtest StrategySpec
            "dataset_ref":   "sma-uptrend.csv",
            "expected":      expectedReport,
            "expected_hash": expectedHash,
        },
        "data": candles,
    }
    cmd, _ := json.Marshal(runCase)
    out, err := b.Command(string(cmd))
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(out) // the full CaseResult as JSON
}
```

### Commands

| `cmd`         | Payload             | Response                                |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `run_case`    | `{case, data}`      | the full `CaseResult`                   |
| `run_suite`   | `{suite, datasets}` | a `SuiteReport`                         |
| `list_cases`  | `{suite}`           | `{ids:[...]}` (sorted)                  |
| `version`     | —                   | `{version:...,engine_version:...}`      |

`data` is a slice of candles; `datasets` maps each `dataset_ref` to its candle
slice.

Domain errors (a bad case, an unknown command) come back in-band as
`{ok:false,error:...}`; only null/UTF-8/panic conditions produce a Go `error`.

## Benchmark

Every binding forwards to the same data-driven Rust core, so what this one adds is
the call overhead of cgo over the C ABI, not a different result. The core's throughput is
measured by the repository's benchmark suite and the nightly `bench.yml` run; the
numbers, the machine and how to reproduce them are in the repository
[BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-benchmark/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md).

## Documentation

The full guide, the spec reference and the API documentation live in the main
repository and the documentation site:

- **Repository:** <https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-benchmark>
- **Docs** (guides, spec reference, cookbook): <https://benchmark.wickra.org>
- **Runnable example:** [`examples/go/`](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-benchmark/tree/main/examples/go)

Wickra Benchmark ships native bindings for Python, Node.js, WASM and Rust, plus a C ABI hub that any
C-capable language (C, C++, C#, Go, Java, R) links against — all forwarding to the
same data-driven, `unsafe`-forbidden Rust core.

## Security

Found a security issue? **Please don't open a public issue.** Report it privately
via the repository's *Security* tab (*"Report a vulnerability"*) or email
**support@wickra.org** with a subject line starting `[wickra security]`. Full
policy: <https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-benchmark/blob/main/SECURITY.md>.

## Disclaimer

`wickra-benchmark` is research and engineering tooling, not financial advice. A
passing case attests only that a report is the deterministic result of a given
strategy over given data — it makes no claim about the quality, profitability or
future performance of any strategy, nor about whether the data is representative
of any market. Trading carries risk; you are responsible for your own decisions.
`wickra-benchmark` is free software you run yourself: no hosted service, no data
collection, no warranty.
